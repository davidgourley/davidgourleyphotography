                Aside from photography, one of my main passions lies in becoming a Data Scientist or Data Analyst. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Data Science at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University. Creating this website was a personal project of mine that helped further advance my skill in coding and web design! I have a profound interest for sports statistics, more specifically basketball, where I aim to analyze game data and player performance to gain deeper insights into the sport's trends and strategies. In my freshmen year of college, I took a photography class as an elective and purchased a Canon EOS Rebel T7 that truly advanced my interest in it. I'd always enjoy taking unique photos with iPhone's, but I felt buying this would help progress my skills, while still being welcoming to beginners. And now, with the creation of this website, I'm able to share to the public two interests of mine: coding/web design and photography! As for why I love photography so much, it definitely lies with the idea that you can capture different moments, memories, and important places in my life where a variety of memories lay. Each shot is a different moment in time. And while it's not possible to relive a memory in its exact form the way it is, photography at least helps preserve a piece of it. I view it as a journey throughout my life. Memories can and will fade as you continue living, but an image will remain unchanged and live as a reminder to different experiences, where I have been, and what I've felt. And sometimes I just take pictures of things I find interesting!
